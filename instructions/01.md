#  Building an end to end analytics pipeline in Microsoft Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

Driving Company provides payment processing services for business. It is designing and implementing a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a unified data analytics platform. Their soft goals is to bring siloed teams to work together on a single platform.

In this lab, you will play the role of various persona: a data engineer, a business analyst and a datascientist. The workspace is awill be setup by you in before the hands on part so you can focus on some of the core development capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics.

By the end of this workshop, you will have performed a non-exhaustive list of operations that combine the strength of Big Data and SQL analytics into a single platform.

## **Getting Started**

1. Navigate to https://portal.azure.com/  and login to Azure with the username **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />** and Password **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />** and Click on **Sign in**

### Task 4: Create the Power BI linked service

   Inorder to create Power BI linked service firstly you need to create a PowerBI workspace.

1. Create a Power BI workspace
   - Login to http://app.powerbi.com/  using your credentials from the environment details page.
   - Navigate to Workspaces -> Create a workspace
   
   ![Create workspace](images/7.png)

   - Create a PowerBI workspace and name it **labignitePBIxxxxxx** where xxxxxx is the deployment id,copy the value of Deployment ID from the environment details page and ensure to replace it in the place of xxxxxx
   - Click on **Save**
   
   ![Powerbi workspace](images/8.png)
     
2. Now create a PowerBI linked service

   - Click on **+New** under the Manage Section->Linked services and select **Power BI** for creating Power BI linked service.
